    "## Introduction\n",
    "Toy Story was released in 1995 as the first full length film produced entirely through computer animation techniques (cite Henne). Besides Pixar's production, several applications employ digital animations to entertain, convey information, educate, among others. Some exploits the use of virtual human models to make the human-computer interatction more natural and accessible. Talita, the virtual human of the TAS project (cite De Martino), is a signing avatar that communicates with deaf students using the Brazilian Sign Language. The goal of the TAS project is to help the deaf and hard of hearing to access information and in their educational process.\n",

    "Humans uses not only the voice and facial expression cues to understand intentions, motives and wills, but also the movements of our body and limbs may carry semantic information on the emotion that one is triyng to express. The location, orientation and speed of the hand are some of the parameters that characterizes a sign language gesture, slightly discrepancies will express different messages or even make the gesture unrecognizable. Therefore, an accurate motion representation by the virtual agent should be of great concern."
